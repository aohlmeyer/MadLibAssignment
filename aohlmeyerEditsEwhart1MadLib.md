	In the meadows surrounding London, in the late 1800s, there lay a young fox*  named Pocahontas*  contemplating a scene that
 was playing out in front of the tree he sat upon. The spectacle he beheld was a(n) old*  woman under scrutiny for something that he could 
not quite make out. Recognizing the woman as his childhood nanny, young Pocahontas*  sprang to his feet and approached the scene
 quickly*. He knew not yet what he would say in defense of his previous caretaker, for he did not know whether she was guilty or not,
 however he felt a stong urge welling up in his throat, ready to burst from his vocal chords.
	 "Hey*!" he yelled to the ugly* group of men surrounding his old friend. Puzzled, they turned to face young Pocahantas* with his chest out, standing more confidently than a young boy who just shot his first 10 point buck*. An eruption of noise* came from the men as they
observed our young hero, standing up for his old friend. Then an old voice came from amongst the men and silence fell over them. 
	"Pocahontas*" the woman said. "I am guilty. I am guilty of arson*. One day I was in the town and I felt the urge to set buildings on fire*. Now as you know this is punishable by banishment*. However, if you will testify on my behalf, I may be relieved of this
 charge. What say you?"
	Following a moment of contemplation, Pocahontas* simply replied, "naw*."
